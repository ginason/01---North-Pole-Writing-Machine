Re: Christmas Toy Invoice

Below are the charges for <%= name %>'s Christmas toy order. The cost for each toy is a percentage of your home's estimated value. The cost includes delivery fee, service fee and the North Pole transportation tax. HST is separate.

=================
<%= name %>'s Toy Order
=================
<% if behavior == 'naughty'%>
$<%= defective_toy %>  1 defective toy
----
$<%= defective_toy %> Subtotal
$<%= defective_toy *0.13 %>  HST
====
$<%= (defective_toy * 1.13).round(2)%>

P.S. For a limited time get 25% off the best-seller by Ms. Claus, Iâ€™m Getting Nothing for Christmas: Raising Toy-Worthy Children in a Device-Driven World.
<% else %>
<%toy_hash.each do |toy, price| %>
<%= toy %> : $<%= price %>
<%end%>
----
$<%= total_toy %>  Subtotal
$<%= total_toy * 0.13 %>  HST
====
$<%= (total_toy * 1.13).round(2) %>  Total

Your total comes to $<%= (total_toy * 1.13).round(2) %> Payment is due upon receipt of invoice. Should you fail to submit prompt payment we will repossess all toys in this order by January 7.  I encourage you to imagine the tantrum that will ensue should all of <%=name%>'s toys suddenly disappear.

Due to a high number of NSF incidents we no longer accept personal cheques. Please make all payments through PayPal, Interac e-transfer or certified cheque.
